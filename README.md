## CASE_STUDY_ON_DIFFERENT_CLASSIFICATION_ALGORITHMS
#### In this case study, I have trained different machine learning classification algorithms on two datasets.
#### The datasets that I use here are MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset and CIFAR10 Object Classification dataset. 
### 1.  MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images with a resolution of 28 x 28 pixels each.
 It consist of classes of images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

### 2. CIFAR10 Object Classification Dataset

 CIFAR10 dataset consist of 50,000 training images 10,000  testing images with a resolution of 32 x 32 pixels each.
 It consists of images of ten type of objects.

##### Data source:  https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

#### Both datasets consist of ten classes each.
#### Both datasets are trained on machine learning algorithms such as KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and CNN. 
#### The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are also observed for each algorithm.
